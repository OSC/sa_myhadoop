myHadoop
========

This represents a continuation of the myHadoop project which provided a
framework for dynamically provisioning Hadoop clusters within traditional
clusters and supercomputers that use batch systems such as Torque or
SLURM.

The original myHadoop distribution can be found on SourceForge: http://sourceforge.net/projects/myhadoop

This fork of myHadoop is being developed and maintained by Glenn K. Lockwood.

Pre-requisites
--------------
myHadoop needs Apache Hadoop 0.20.2 and a batch scheduler such as PBS.
